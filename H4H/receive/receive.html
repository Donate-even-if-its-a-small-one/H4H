    1.To act as a bridge between the privileged and the needy –Philanthrophists
        who wish to donate can look for all 
    details of nearby NGO’s.Similarly,NGO’s who wish to receive offerings 
    can fill their details in our website.These registered NGO’s will be shown
     to the user. That’s how we bridge the gap .
<br><br>
    2.To make many unknown NGOs or charities recognized-Many NGO’s are in 
    high    need of resources to run and grow their organisations.They are ready
     to accept any donations that come their way.They need a platform for their
      NGO to get recognized.”Receive” option in our website provides this 
      platform.
<br><br>
  3.Our aim is to encourage society to support the underprivileged-There are
   many philanthrophists in and around our surrounding who are ready to lend 
   their help.Our website helps these givers by providing complete information
    about local NGO’s.It gives information about the location of NGO,donations they accept etc.
